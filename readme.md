Project Overview

This project is an online survey about personal health that will later be integrated into an existing website (www.fitandwell.ch). The survey is designed to be mobile-first and should look good on both mobile devices and desktop computers. The survey consists of 10 questions and a feedback page, with navigation buttons in the header of each page for easy navigation.

Technology Stack

HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5 for the front-end design and layout
JavaScript for form validation and dynamic elements
PHP for data collection and feedback generation
Git and GitHub for source control
Figma for mockups
VS Code and PHP Server for development

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design and Layout

The design and layout of the survey were created using Bootstrap 5, a popular front-end framework that allows for easy responsive design and mobile-first development. The layout is clean and simple, with the questions and answers centered on the screen. The navigation buttons are located in the header of each page for easy access.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Form Validation

The survey includes JavaScript form validation to ensure that at least one valid input is provided for each question page. This is done by adding the "required" attribute to each input element and using the validateForm() function to check if the input fields have been filled before proceeding to the next page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Collection and Feedback Generation

The survey uses PHP to collect data from the user's responses and generate feedback. The $_POST and $_SESSION superglobals are used to access and store the user's responses. The feedback page uses string concatenation and templates to display a summary of the user's responses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source Control and Development

The project was developed using VS Code and PHP Server. Git and GitHub were used for source control, and Figma was used for mockups. The code was organized and structured in a way that makes it easy to understand and maintain.

Conclusion

This survey project is a great example of how to create a simple yet effective online survey using modern web development technologies. The design and layout are clean and simple, the form validation ensures that all inputs are valid, and the data collection and feedback generation are handled efficiently using PHP. The project is also easy to understand and maintain, making it a great starting point for further development and customization.
